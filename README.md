# SC1015 mini-project assignment
Our team's objective is to make use of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness">World Happiness Index</a> data gathered from Kaggle to predict future happiness scores based on the variables included in the dataset. This can then be used as a metric to evaluate certain policy changes or to identify the key aspects that influence perceived happiness, which can serve to guide any prospective candidates for election in the future towards addressing matters that have more impact on one's perceived wellbeing for example.
