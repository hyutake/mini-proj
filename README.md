# SC1015 mini-project assignment
Our team's objective is to make use of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness">World Happiness Index</a> data gathered from Kaggle to predict future happiness scores based on the variables included in the dataset. This can then be used as a metric to evaluate certain policy changes or to identify the key aspects that influence perceived happiness, which can serve to guide any prospective candidates for election in the future towards addressing matters that have more impact on one's perceived wellbeing for example.

# Libraries used
<ul>
  <li>Pandas
  <li>Numpy
  <li>Seaborn
  <li>Plotly
  <li>Keras
  <li>Scikit learn
</ul>

# Problem definitionn
<ul>
  <li>Can we predict future Happiness Scores of countries?
  <li>What model is the best in doing so?
</ul>

# Models used
<ul>
  <li>Linear Regression (Multi-variate)
  <li>Recurrent Neural Networks using Long Short Term Memory
</ul>

# Datasets
Dataset used for the project can be found in this folder. It consists of data collected through the World Happiness Report for the years 2015 - 2019

# Conclusion
<ul>
  <li>GDP has the highest correlation to Happiness Score out of other variables such as Life expectancy, Family, Freedom and Govt. trust.
  <li>Majority of the top 10 happiest countries over 2015 - 2019 are from Western Europe
  <li>Majority of the bottom 10 happiest countries over 2015 - 2019 are from Sub-Saharan Africa
  <li>Multi-variate linear regression performed quite poorly compared to Recurrent Neural Networks
  <li>Although predictions on future happiness scores were quite accurate based on the available data, actual future happiness scores can easily vary with significant events such as the Covid-19 pandemic or the Ukraine war.
</ul>

# What did we learn?
<ul>
  <li>Neural networks, keras and tensorflow
  <li>Plotly graphs that are interactive (rendered to be png format to be visualised on GitHub)
